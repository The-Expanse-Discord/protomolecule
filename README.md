General purpose bot for The Expanse Discord server.

## Running locally

Put the following in a file named config.json5:

```json
{
	"token": "<bot token>",
	"owner": "<owner discord id>",
	"commandPrefix": ".",
	"statusType": "WATCHING",
	"statusText": "you sleep...",
	"unlimitedRoles": [ "The Rocinante", "Moderation Team" ],
	// Lists which channels to respond to commands in. Use "all" in the list to respond in all visible channels.
	"commandChannels": ["all"],
	// A map from servers to reaction channels
	"welcomeChannels": {
        "{SERVER_ID}": "{CHANNEL_ID}",
    },
	// Database to track if member is established
	"establishedMemberJsonFile": "{JSON_FILE}",
	// Role to give members that have done enough to be 'established'
    "establishedMemberRole": "{ESTABLISHED_MEMBER_ROLE_NAME}",
	// categories where messages don't count towards whether you are an established member
	"establishedMemberExcludedCategories": [],
	// The "moderator" user that people can message with questions
    "moderatorUserId": "USER_ID",
	// A channel where the bot will watch and react with a rocket ship for voting
    "amaChannel": "CHANNEL_ID",
	// A file to log to. Note that these will be rotated by wintston
    "logFile": "test.log",
}
```

Use npx to run the bot:
`npx @the-expanse-discord/rocinante-discord config.json`

Or install the command and run it:
```sh
npm install -g @the-expanse-discord/rocinante-discord

rocinante-discord cconfig.json5
```




## Developer Setup
Copy the example config files over to a usable config.
```sh
cp .\config.example.json5 config.json5
```

### Update Configs
View the files and identify the values that you need to supply.

npm install
npm run dev
 - Edit `config.json` with the appropriate values.
	- `token` - Discord bot token.
	- `owner` - The Discord ID of the bot owner.
	- `commandPrefix` - Specify the command prefix.
	- `statusType` - What status is the bot?
	- `statusText` - Accompanying text for the bot status.
	- `unlimitedRoles` - Names of roles that aren't affected by rate limiting.
	- `commandChannels` - Lists which channels to respond to commands in. Use "all" in the list to respond in all visible channels.
	- `welcomeChannels` - A mapping of guild IDs to welcome channels. The Rocinante will use these to automatically create a welcome message and messages to react to.

After running these, you will also need to set up any guilds in welcomeChannels with the appropriate emoji and roles.

You can set up emoji with appropriate images and names matching those in the Emoji.ts file under `src/Infrastructure/Enums/Role Assignment`. You'll also have to set up roles with the same names (although spaces are allowed in the roles).

```

npm run code:build
```
